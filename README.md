# In my capstone project for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate, I built the Little Lemon Website, a responsive restaurant website using React.js and modern front-end technologies. The project involved designing interactive UI components, implementing dynamic routing, and ensuring accessibility best practices. I also integrated form validation, state management with useState and useEffect, and optimized performance for a seamless user experience. ðŸš€
